# MAP Adventures
A quick resource to find ideas for great places to go locally, a bit farther out, and across the world. 

**Link to project:** [https://mapadventures.netlify.app/](https://mapadventures.netlify.app/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

Would love to expand this to a full-stack social app so that users could submit places to expand the lists. 

## Lessons Learned:

Font Awesome is a great tool but can create issues for formatting. I learned how to format things so that
the icons would cooperate with the rest of the site.
